Pinterest

A really basic implementation of Pinterest that i will work only on my free time
I did it for fun, so feel free to use or do whatever you want.

What you can do :
register as a basic user (devise)
post pins
  - with images (Paperclip)
vote (acts_as_votable)
smooth redisplay of pins with (masonry) and a bit of js
and (bootstrap sass) for styling


The next step are :
- "Unlike" posts
- list all liked post in a dedicated section
- implement comment on pins
- create categories for pins


aaaand ... i think that's it. I may add some more if i figure out cool features to add


Love !
